# COMP 3004 (F24) Final Project

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is archived as of December 31, 2024 and will be read-only from now on.

## Project Information
This was the final project for the COMP 3004 (Object-Oriented Software Engineering) at Carleton University where the goal was to create a simulator for the RaDoTech device, a health-monitoring device developed by a company of the same name **(please read the disclaimer below.)** The app in this project was written in C++ with the cross-platform Qt framework. Therefore, this app can be run on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Our team collaborated using GitHub for source control, backup and submit our project for marking. Because of this project, we learned how to use branches, submitting issues and pull requests, as well as spending some time together on video calls to resolve small and large merge conflicts.

> [!NOTE]
> **DISCLAIMER**
>
> This project was created purely for **educational purpose** and was NEVER meant to replace the actual device in terms of medical and commercial uses.
> This repository is public because the team behind this project wanted to present our coding experience in C++ and the Qt framework for our resumes, and NOT to promote a copy/clone of the original device.
> Please do not use the app in this repository for measuring your own vital signs. This app does NOT actually measure a person's vital sign, it is purely a simulator.
